/**
 * Permanent (non-dismissible) banner at the top of the Dashboard.
 *
 * Trimmed down from an earlier version that greeted the user by name and
 * repeated the WhatsApp CTA verbatim — now that WelcomeModal shows on
 * EVERY login (not just the first ever) and already includes the
 * WhatsApp link plus the full VIP plans list, having this banner say the
 * same "Welcome, [name] — join our community" right underneath felt
 * redundant, like being greeted twice in a row. This banner still keeps
 * the WhatsApp link always reachable on the page itself (not just inside
 * a dismissible popup), but doesn't duplicate the modal's greeting text.
