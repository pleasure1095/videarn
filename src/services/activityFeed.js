 * Builds a unified "Recent Activity" timeline for a user by combining
 * several existing data sources rather than maintaining a separate
 * activity-log collection. Every event type here is derived from data we
 * already store for other reasons (deposits, notifications) — this
 * function's only job is presentation: normalize each into a common
 * {type, title, amount, sign, ts} shape and sort by time.
 *
 * Notifications already cover deposit approval/rejection, referral
 * bonuses, and withdrawal requests, so we don't re-derive those directly
 * from the deposits collection (would double them up) — we read
 * notifications for those events, and read deposits only for the recurring
 * "daily profit" entries notifications don't cover.
